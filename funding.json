In-Memoria is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that solves the token efficiency crisis through persistent intelligence and input optimization. As AI inference costs rise due to power and compute constraints, In-Memoria addresses waste at the source: 93% reduction in project context tokens, eliminating redundant retransmission, and enabling cumulative intelligence. Built with Rust core and TypeScript orchestration, it provides AST-based semantic analysis for 11 languages, pattern learning, smart file routing, and token-optimized project blueprints. Works with Claude, Copilot, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible AI assistant. Currently at v0.5.7 with 98.3% test pass rate and zero memory leaks. Serves as foundational infrastructure enabling cost-effective, environmentally sustainable AI development workflows globally while maintaining local-first privacy.",
