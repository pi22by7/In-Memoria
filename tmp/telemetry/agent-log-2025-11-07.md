# Agent Log — 2025-11-07

- Branch: `feat/php-core-only`
- Scope: Trim PHP PR to core extractor + sandbox sample.
- Actions today:
  - Updated progress-tracker, MCP integration, automation, monitoring, and validation tests to reflect the consolidated tool surface (no more `get_learning_status`/`quick_setup`).
  - Adjusted progress tracker expectations to match the simplified console output.
  - Updated `validation.ts` + test suites to the new tool list and added `get_project_blueprint`/`health_check` schemas.
  - Changed Rust default features to drop `napi-bindings` and pass `--features napi-bindings` only during the napi build so `cargo test` no longer hits linker errors.
- Actions (ongoing session):
  - Re-validated maintainer scope (keep extractor/registry/TS wiring/sandbox + README/CHANGELOG; remove telemetry docs/scripts/workflows/fixtures) and confirmed no residual references via `rg`.
  - Ran `npm run build` + `npm test` (both ✅) and `cargo test -p in-memoria-core` (expected failures remain in framework detector, Python extractor, fallback parser, SQL extractor; no linker issues).
  - Trimmed `docs/release-checklist.md` to remove references to the deleted telemetry scripts and note that tool-usage reviews rely on manual dashboards until telemetry returns.
- Tests:
  - `npm run build` ✅
  - `npm test` ✅ (all suites now green after the test updates)
  - `cargo test -p in-memoria-core` ⚠️ builds and runs, but still reports existing semantic/framework extractor failures (e.g., `analysis::frameworks::tests::test_detect_react_from_package_json`, `analysis::frameworks::tests::test_detect_python_frameworks`, `extractors::python::tests::test_python_class_extraction`, `parsing::fallback::tests::test_extract_multiple_concepts`, `extractors::sql::tests::test_comprehensive_table_extraction`). No remaining linker issues.
- Next: decide whether to triage the outstanding Rust unit failures or defer them, then review the ~500 LOC diff and open the lean “core-only PHP” PR.
